# Data-Preprocessing-of-Web-Usage-Data
In this project, it presents the data pre-processing of a web usage log file for creating users' browsing sequence of web pages on a website.

## Users' Usage Data of NASA Website
In this project, it uses the small dataset (e.g., 50000 log records) extracted from the full users' usage dataset of NASA website using a Python script. The full dataset is available on this web page, http://ita.ee.lbl.gov/html/contrib/NASA-HTTP.html.<br />

## Example of Log Data and Users' Browsing Sequence
The example of log data format can be found [here](https://github.com/yuhsiangfu/data-preprocessing-of-web-usage-data/blob/master/example/example_log-file.txt). Another example of users' browsing sequence after data-preprocessing can be found [here](https://github.com/yuhsiangfu/data-preprocessing-of-web-usage-data/blob/master/example/example_browsing-sequence.txt).<br />
